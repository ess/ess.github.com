Have you ever wanted to create your very own client for a REST API? Tearing apart such APIs and figuring out a way to work with them is a big part of what I do every day.

So, I've started writing a book about rolling one's own REST API client. It's called Cartography. You can read what there is of it so far [here](https://ess.github.io/cartography), but keep in mind that I literally started writing today, and it's very much WIP.

Also, I'm using a language that I don't know, Python, to illustrate the creation of an API client. Whether you're looking to learn how to do it or just want to see what it looks like when somebody who doesn't know the language tries to use the language, please do check it out and enjoy.
