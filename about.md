I'm a time traveller from right now ... the present.

### More Information ###

I currently work at [Slim](https://slim.ai) as a member of the technical staff, primarily focused on pretty much all things related to feature development, testing, and maintainability of the backend.

Before that, I was a Cloud Architect at [Stark & Wayne](https://starkandwayne.com). We did some really neat CloudFoundry stuff for various clients, and probably my favorite thing that happened over the course of that run was the creation of more-or-less a drop-in replacement for scheduler-for-pcf. I also developed a possibly unhealthy love of hyphenation.

Some time ago, I worked at [Engine Yard](https://www.engineyard.com) helping to devise reasonable custom solutions to the problems that our customers want to solve. Generally speaking that meant doing up custom chef cookbooks, occasionally writing [custom software](https://github.com/engineyard/scaley), and doing quite a lot of mentoring for our DevOps Support staff. I was also the fella responsible for designing and implementing the new platform, [Engine Yard Kontainers](https://support.cloud.engineyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058885853-Introduction-to-Engine-Yard-Kontainers).

In a former life, I was a software engineer at [Elevator Up](http://elevatorup.com), working primarily on Ruby applications and assorted infrastructure stuff.

Before all of that, I worked other places, but I'm not writing a book here. I'm doing that [over here](https://ess.github.io/cartography).

When I'm not stuck in front of a computerbox, I greatly enjoy building cigar box guitars, reading comics, staring into the void, and having heated debates with my dog, Jake.
